**Limitations & Future Scope:-**
- The overall project can be upgraded by adding a new feature which recommends movies based on the previous searches (fetching from the historical data) and displaying movies related to those genres.
- Secondly, we can add a backend to create a ticket booking system by implementing it in  PHP/Node js.
- We can add OTP verification system while user registers in the website.
- Online payment method can be added.
